sometimes I just want to sleep
but never when I'm awake

Its that time of year
when the astronaut has to get strapped into
a scientific rollercoaster
because going to the moon aint easy
you gtta have the right stuff

the scientific roller coaster
spins you around and around
and around and around
so you feel at home in space
with all the spinning globes
and spinning stars
spinning around and around

do you have the right stuff?
can you blow bubbles through a straw
like your life depended on it?
can you hold it
when you need to go?
there's no bathrooms in space
